I am intrested in taking this class because I want to try something new out of my comfort zone. I also believe this will help me develop new skills and build up my creativity even more and my problem solving skills.
One thing that I find curious about computer or technology is learning how to code or atleast the basic enought were I could see errors in my work and learn from them and fix them.
