The reason i am interseted in taking computer science is because id like to expand my knowledge of coding and how it works. Its always been something that appeared interseting and ive never tried looking into it until now. I also believe it is something that will allow me too push myself, as its something i am not too familiar with.
One thing i am curious about related to computing or technology is how code can turn into apps that we can use.
