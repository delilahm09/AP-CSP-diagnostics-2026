The first thing that I did when I opened the repository is that I tried to figure out how to create a markdown file in the introductions folder like the assesment tasks said. The most confusing moment was when I was figuring out how to create all of these folders in the right place, but I figured it out eventually. Strategies that I used when I was stuck was that I just read the instructions, and compared what the instrustions told me to look for and what I saw on the folder thingys and that really helped me when I didnt know what i was looking for. I decided what information to read or skip by just skimming through whatever I was reading, and then reading it more closely if I thought that i saw something that would be useful. I feel more confident about finding my way in things that ive never done before since I have never been in this github thing before, but I still figured out how to do everything. Something that still feels sort of unclear is whether or not i did this right because im pretty sure I did it right based on what the tasks told me to do, but im not 100% certain.
