1.The first thing i did when i opened the repository was hover over the different items and see what they redirected me to.
2.the most confusing moment to me was finding out how to copy the repository as i tried to do it by myself with no outside help.
3. I used AI to give me step by step tutorials whenever u got stuck, i also made sure to check the github docs page to see if they had any solutions to my problems.
4. I made sure to read all the information as this is a important class and i really want to join it.
5.Now that i know the basics im more confident using github and adding/editing my files.
6.Im still unclear on how we will use github to start coding.
