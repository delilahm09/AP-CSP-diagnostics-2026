The first thing i did when i opened this repository was look around it, try and explore it. I was trying to just see where things were and get to know the repository.
The most confusing moment was getting started, some of the words were a bit confusing and it was a bit hard to even get started. 
One of the stratigies i used was using tools such as google for help on getting familiar with github as a platform, to help me locate different things on the website.
I decided not skip any information. I decided too read every instruction on the README.md, and made sure to reread certain things. I am not familiar with the website and it was important to read everything so i can know what to do and how to get around.
I feel more confident navigating the repository and getting around. I feel like i can carry out instruction without having to reread or being stuck on it as much.
Something that still feels unclear is some of the terms and words i see on the website. I am not too familiar with them and it can still be unclear to me what they may be refering too.
