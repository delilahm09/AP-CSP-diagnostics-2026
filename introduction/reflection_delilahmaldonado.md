1.)The first thing I did when I opened the repository was read the instructions multiple times and looked at all the buttons on the page.
2.)The most confusing part was figuring out how to create my own copy of the repository and navigating this new site. 
3.)The stategies I used when I got stuck was reading the instructions very carefully and exploring which button would make a copy of the repository because that was the only part that I was stuck on. I honestly took an educated guess on which button would work and hoped it wouldn't delete everything.
4.) I decided to read all the information given in the instructions, or tried to at least because I accidentally skipped this question. I did decide also to read all the information in the "what counts as a success" and "you do need to do" because I wanted to know what was required of me. I skipped through information I knew I wouldn't need like the AI policy because I don't use AI in my work. 
5.) I feel more confident navigating the repository now in comparison to when I first started and I feel confident making new files and figuring out certain aspects of github like files. 
6.) What still feels unclear is maybe how I can use this website in class to code because I've never coded before (besides in elementary on basic level websites like stractch).
